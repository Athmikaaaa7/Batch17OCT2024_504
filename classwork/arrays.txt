what are arrays? why are they needed?
data structure storing collection of ele of same type and in same order.stored in contiguous memory loc.
(to organise data for efficient access and manipulation)
fixed size
sequentially indexed

a+= (+=: modifies the existing list in place)

declaration or syntax: <type array name[no. of ele]>   int- A CONTIGUOUS MEMORY ALLOC OF NO. OF ELE
values can be assigned to variables

& is used to get loc of memory: &<arrayname>[index]

arrays can be declared with initialization: int marks[7]={1,2,3,4,5}

negative value is invalid as index

array indices n to n-1 is correct

ptr++ : It returns the size, in bytes, of the pointer itself, not the size of the data it points to


In C, static variables are initialized to zero by default if no other initializers are provided.
static int arr2[MAX]
